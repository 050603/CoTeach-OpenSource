Please generate scene outlines based on the following course requirements.

## User Requirements

{{requirement}}

---

{{userProfile}}

## Language Context

Infer the course language directive by applying the decision rules from the system prompt. Key reminders:
- Requirement language = teaching language (unless overridden by explicit request or learner context)
- Foreign language learning → teach in user's native language, not the target language
- PDF language does NOT override teaching language — translate/explain document content instead

## Output Requirements

Please automatically infer the following from user requirements:

- Course topic and core content
- Target audience and difficulty level
- Course duration (default 15-30 minutes if not specified)
- Teaching style (formal/casual/interactive/academic)
- Visual style (minimal/colorful/professional/playful)

Then output your response as a single JSON object.

**Top-level shape — this is what you MUST return:**

```json
{
  "languageDirective": "2-5 sentence instruction describing the course language behavior",
  "courseTitle": "concise course name, ≤30 chars, in the teaching language",
  "outlines": [ /* array of scene objects, schema described below */ ]
}
```

Every slide also includes a decision-complete `visualIntent`. Use text alone when that is clearest; do not manufacture an image request for every page. When visible appearance, a concrete scene, or an object-to-object difference is needed, bind a suitable source image or a generated image when image generation is enabled. Use native diagrams/charts for relationships, flows, and supplied quantitative data. A concept diagram and a concrete case illustration may coexist. Choose images by distinct teaching observations, with no image quota.

Never return a bare array. Never omit `languageDirective` or `courseTitle`. All three keys are required.

**Each scene inside the `outlines` array has this minimum shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "scene_1",
  "type": "slide" | "quiz" | "interactive" | "pbl",
  "title": "For slide: formal heading for its actual knowledge, e.g. 项目式学习 or 项目式学习的核心特征; for other scene types: a title suited to the activity",
  "description": "Teaching purpose description",
  "keyPoints": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"],
  "order": 1,
  "visualIntent": {
    "observationGoal": "What learners inspect on this page",
    "representation": "text" | "source-image" | "generated-image" | "native-diagram" | "native-chart" | "table" | "video" | "mixed",
    "rationale": "Why this form best supports the teaching goal",
    "diagram": {
      "topology": "sequence",
      "nodes": [{ "id": "step_1", "label": "First step" }, { "id": "step_2", "label": "Second step" }],
      "edges": [{ "from": "step_1", "to": "step_2", "label": "Optional relationship label" }],
      "annotation": "Optional explanation of the whole diagram, not another step"
    },
    "resourceRefs": [
      {
        "resourceId": "a stable source or generated-media ID",
        "kind": "source-image" | "generated-image" | "generated-video",
        "required": true,
        "reason": "Why this resource is needed",
        "observationGoal": "What to inspect in this resource"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Special Notes

- **quiz scenes must include quizConfig**:
   ```json
   "quizConfig": {
     "questionCount": 2,
     "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
     "questionTypes": ["single", "multiple"]
   }
   ```
{{#if hasSourceImages}}
- **If source images are available**, preserve `suggestedImageIds` for compatibility and also bind selected IDs in `visualIntent.resourceRefs`. Only use IDs listed under Available Images. Images marked `textbook relation: direct (required)` are mandatory on the first full teaching page for their linked knowledge point; `candidate` images are not mandatory.
{{/if}}
- **Interactive scenes**: If a concept benefits from hands-on simulation/visualization, use `"type": "interactive"` with `widgetType` and `widgetOutline` fields. Limit to 1-2 per course.
   - Select widgetType based on concept: simulation (physics/chem), diagram (processes), code (programming), game (practice), visualization3d (3D models)
   - Provide appropriate widgetOutline for the widget type
- **Scene count**: Based on inferred duration, typically 1-2 scenes per minute
- **Quiz placement**: Recommend inserting a quiz every 3-5 slides for assessment
- **Language**: Infer from the user's requirement text and context, then output all content in the inferred language
- **If web search results are provided**, reference specific findings and sources in scene descriptions and keyPoints. The search results provide up-to-date information — incorporate it to make the course content current and accurate.

**Final reminder**: your entire response must be a JSON **object** with exactly three top-level keys — `languageDirective` (string), `courseTitle` (string, ≤30 chars, in the teaching language), and `outlines` (array). Do not return a bare array. Do not wrap in prose or code fences.
