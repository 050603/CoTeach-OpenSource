Keep the complete native slide design: editable elements, shapes, tables, charts, rich text emphasis, borders, accent bars, pictures and the authored page hierarchy. Return {"background":...,"elements":[...],"components":[...]}. Components are optional local helpers; do not replace the page with a flow layout or split it into continuation pages. Preserve a coherent teaching page, with concise visible evidence and deeper spoken reasoning in narration.
Use the original typography and content-specific composition from the slide design instructions. All visible text is measured with the playback font. Preserve semantic paragraph breaks; a short label must not leave a single Chinese character, including its punctuation, alone on a wrapped line. Allocate enough width and height at the chosen readable font size; do not omit meaning to fit.
Optional text component: {"kind":"textBox","id":"stable-id","left":60,"top":140,"width":360,"height":90,"text":"a concise statement","fontSize":18,"bold":false,"color":"#334155","role":"body|label|title"}. Height is an estimate; the compiler uses the measured height and checks it against nearby foreground content and the slide boundary. Do not assign a guessed hard maxHeight to fit text. Use native text elements for mixed emphasis, colors, or font sizes.
Optional aligned label component: {"kind":"labelGrid","id":"stable-id","left":60,"top":140,"width":880,"height":200,"rows":[{"header":"dimension","cells":["first","second"]}],"fontSize":16}. Native tables remain available and preferred for genuine tables.
Planned relationship component: {"type":"diagram","id":"stable-id","left":60,"top":140,"width":880,"height":330,"topology":"sequence|cycle|branch","nodes":[{"id":"a","label":"step"},{"id":"b","label":"next"}]}. Its rectangle and optional accentColor/nodeFill/textColor belong to your page design; the compiler supplies the exact planned nodes and edges. The planned annotation supplies explanatory evidence, not an obligation to repeat a full source paragraph inside the graph. Select a concise accurate annotation only if helpful, or display its needed meaning in nearby native text; include it explicitly as component.annotation and reserve measured space when selected. Do not draw duplicate diagram nodes/connectors in native elements.
Explicit branch edges, feedback, and sequenceGroups preserve the authoritative topology; independent sequences never gain cross-process connectors.
Arrows, connecting lines, aligned pairs and visual correspondence assert a real teaching relationship. Do not force introductory examples into a one-to-one mapping with concepts, or invent a correspondence, hierarchy or causal link not established by the supplied teaching design. If examples are only an introduction, present them as shared context without misleading connectors.
Components compile inside their allocated rectangles in this same first response. Background surfaces may deliberately contain foreground elements. Keep unrelated foreground content outside each component allocation. Include each required media resource as a native image/video in the page where it supports observation.`,
