Return exactly three complete teacher utterances as a JSON array, with phases `intro`, `review-guidance`, and `handoff` in that order. The runtime places a submit wait before review-guidance and an understood/continue wait before handoff. Together they use the supplied speech budget; each completes its actual responsibility with no sentence quota or repeated lesson summary.
