Generate a deep-interaction course outline based on the following requirements.

## User Requirements

{{requirement}}

{{userProfile}}

## Language Context

Infer the course language directive by applying the decision rules from the system prompt. Key reminders:
- Requirement language = teaching language (unless overridden by explicit request or learner context)
- Foreign language learning → teach in user's native language, not the target language
- PDF language does NOT override teaching language — translate/explain document content instead

## Adaptive Interactive-First Target

- Use more hands-on scenes than standard mode when the subject genuinely benefits from them.
- Decide every scene type from the learning action and knowledge dependency. Do not alternate slide and interaction mechanically, and do not require one interaction after a fixed number of slides.
- An interaction must let the learner manipulate, simulate, inspect, construct, program, compare, or rehearse a meaningful state and receive explanatory feedback.
- Preserve as many slide scenes as are needed for definitions, evidence, worked reasoning, examples, misconceptions, and durable summaries.
- A short or abstract lesson may need only one strong interaction; a longer experimental, spatial, or programming lesson may justify several. There are no widget-type quotas.
- Put formal correctness, scoring, and mastery judgment in an explicit quiz rather than manufacturing a clickable pseudo-interaction.

## CRITICAL: Required Fields for Interactive Scenes

Every interactive scene MUST include:
- `widgetType`: One of "simulation", "diagram", "code", "game", or "visualization3d"
- `widgetOutline`: Object with widget-specific configuration

Interactive scenes without these fields are INVALID.

## Widget Selection Guide

Choose widgets based on the content:

| Content Type | Recommended Widget |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Physics/Chemistry/Biology processes | simulation |
| Systems, processes, hierarchies | diagram |
| Programming, algorithms | code |
| Practice, challenge, application | game (action preferred) |

## Widget Design Principles (IMPORTANT)

### Simulation Widget
- Mobile-friendly: Controls MUST NOT overlap canvas
- Reset button MUST work correctly
- Touch-friendly controls (44px min)

### Diagram Widget
- First node VISIBLE on load (no blank screen)
- HIGH CONTRAST colors
- Add ICONS to nodes
- Color-code node types

### Game Widget (CRITICAL - NO BORING QUIZZES!)
- **PREFER action/puzzle games over quizzes**
- Player MUST control something (not just click answers)
- If using simulation, make it INTERACTIVE gameplay
- Example GOOD game: "Control thrust to land safely"
- Example BAD game: "Click the correct answer"
- `gameType` should be "action", "puzzle", or "strategy", NOT just "quiz"

### Example: Good vs Bad Game Outline

❌ **BAD (boring quiz):**
```json
{
  "widgetType": "game",
  "widgetOutline": {
    "gameType": "quiz",
    "questionCount": 5
  }
}
```

✅ **GOOD (interactive game):**
```json
{
  "widgetType": "game",
  "widgetOutline": {
    "gameType": "action",
    "challenge": "控制推力使飞船安全着陆",
    "playerControls": ["thrust_slider"]
  }
}
```

**Final reminder**: your entire response must be a JSON **object** with exactly three top-level keys — `languageDirective` (string, inferred via the Language Inference rules in the system prompt), `courseTitle` (string, ≤30 chars, in the teaching language), and `outlines` (array of scene objects). Do not return a bare array. Do not wrap in prose or code fences.
