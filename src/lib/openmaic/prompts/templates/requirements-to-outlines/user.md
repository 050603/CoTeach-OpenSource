Please generate scene outlines based on the following course requirements.

## User Requirements

{{requirement}}

---

{{userProfile}}

## Language Context

Infer the course language directive by applying the decision rules from the system prompt. Key reminders:
- Requirement language = teaching language (unless overridden by explicit request or learner context)
- Foreign language learning → teach in user's native language, not the target language
- PDF language does NOT override teaching language — translate/explain document content instead

## Output Requirements

Please automatically infer the following from user requirements:

- Course topic and core content
- Target audience and difficulty level
- Course duration (default 15-30 minutes if not specified)
- Teaching style (formal/casual/interactive/academic)
- Visual style (minimal/colorful/professional/playful)

Then output your response as a single JSON object.

**Top-level shape — this is what you MUST return:**

```json
{
  "languageDirective": "2-5 sentence instruction describing the course language behavior",
  "courseTitle": "concise course name, ≤30 chars, in the teaching language",
  "outlines": [ /* array of scene objects, schema described below */ ]
}
```

Never return a bare array. Never omit `languageDirective` or `courseTitle`. All three keys are required.

**Each scene inside the `outlines` array has this minimum shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "scene_1",
  "type": "slide" | "quiz" | "interactive" | "pbl",
  "title": "For slide: formal heading for its actual knowledge, e.g. 项目式学习 or 项目式学习的核心特征; for other scene types: a title suited to the activity",
  "description": "Teaching purpose description",
  "keyPoints": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"],
  "teachingToolPlan": [{
    "tool": "whiteboard | spotlight | laser-pointer | interactive-widget",
    "trigger": "spoken-content cue",
    "purpose": "specific learning benefit",
    "content": ["exact visible notes or relationships"],
    "required": true
  }],
  "order": 1
}
```

### Special Notes

- **quiz scenes must include quizConfig**:
   ```json
   "quizConfig": {
     "questionCount": 2,
     "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
     "questionTypes": ["single", "multiple", "matching", "true_false", "fill_blank"]
   }
   ```
{{#if hasSourceImages}}
- **If source images are available**, add `suggestedImageIds` to relevant slide scenes. Only use image IDs listed under Available Images.
{{/if}}
- **Interactive scenes**: If a concept benefits from meaningful manipulation, simulation, inspection, construction, programming, comparison, or rehearsal, use `"type": "interactive"` with `widgetType` and `widgetOutline` fields. Choose the count dynamically; there is no widget quota and no fixed slide-to-interaction cadence. Do not manufacture next/previous, reveal-only, or view-details pages as interaction.
   - Select widgetType based on concept: simulation (physics/chem), diagram (processes), code (programming), game (practice), visualization3d (3D models)
   - Provide appropriate widgetOutline for the widget type
- **Scene count**: Fit the inferred duration and the semantic teaching steps. Prefer a smaller number of complete, coherent scenes over a fixed scenes-per-minute formula.
- **Quiz placement**: Group related knowledge into coherent sections. Teach and practise each section first, then end it with one concise mastery quiz covering every taught `knowledgePointId` across the full set. In adaptive mode dynamically use 2–4 questions from `single`, `multiple`, `true_false`, `fill_blank`, and `matching`, with no `short_answer` or `scenario_task`; one question may assess several related points. In constructed-response mode use exactly one comprehensive short answer. Never interrupt an unfinished section with a quiz or append a redundant all-course final quiz.
- **Quiz design**: choose from the supported formats according to the knowledge decision and available answer time, without requiring any fixed type mix. Choice distractors should represent plausible misconceptions. Do not request ordering, sorting, or line-connection questions.
- **Teaching progression**: activate prerequisites before introducing new terminology; explain each unfamiliar term before using it in examples or assessment; move from concrete familiar contexts to mechanism and then application.
- **Teaching tools**: use `teachingToolPlan` for a purposeful whiteboard/canvas/widget moment, not as a quota. A long or abstract oral explanation is a strong signal to externalize steps, relationships, examples, formulae, or code on the whiteboard. The plan must tell the teacher which page triggers it and what students will actually see.
- **Language**: Infer from the user's requirement text and context, then output all content in the inferred language
- **If web search results are provided**, reference specific findings and sources in scene descriptions and keyPoints. The search results provide up-to-date information — incorporate it to make the course content current and accurate.

**Final reminder**: your entire response must be a JSON **object** with exactly three top-level keys — `languageDirective` (string), `courseTitle` (string, ≤30 chars, in the teaching language), and `outlines` (array). Do not return a bare array. Do not wrap in prose or code fences.
